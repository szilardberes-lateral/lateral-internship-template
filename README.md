# How to use the Template

README file

- This is an example README file, that should be edited to contain the structure of our internship
- We should have a section called SETUP in which we will provide all the necessary resources that will be used during the internship
- We should have multiple weekly sections that will contain the list of objectives for that week, as well as the deadlines associated with them
- It's a good idea to take into consideration the number of weeks we have, and establish the objectives of the internship ahead of time
- The estimated time for each objective should take into consideration the baseline knowledge and skill level of the participants
- Ideally we should structure the internship into two stages
- Around 60-70% of the internship should consist of learning courses focused acquiring knowledge, with small individual practice exercises
- In the second half of the internship, we could create a bigger project on which all the participants can work together
- In the Discussion tab on GitHub, we can have a weekly Research section and a weekly Q&A section
- In the Research section each participant can summarize their acquired knowledge, and this can serve as a way to track their progress
- In the Q&A section each participant can summarize their questions, and we should have a weekly group meeting to answer all of these
- Each week, after the Q&A questions have been answered, we should have a second meeting where we evaluate their theoretical knowledge
- We should also evaluate based on technical skill, which should be reflected by their practice exercises
- In the second part of the internship we can use the Projects tab on GitHub to assign tickets to each participant and simulate the development life-cycle

Branches

- The Master branch will be used to keep the README file updated, in case the structure of the internship needs to change
- Learning git operations is also a very important part of the internship
- Each participant should create their own branch, where they will make regular commits containing their practice exercises
- Each participant should create a new branch each week, and merge back into their original branch after they pass a code review 
- Example branches are provided in this repository

Internal documents

- We should create internal documents that are only accessible to mentors
- We should have weekly reviews and evaluations for each participant
- Performance should also be evaluated from multiple angles, like: technical skills, theoretical knowledge, team work, soft skills, ability to respect deadlines etc
- We should have a weekly ladder to rank the participants based on their performance that week
- It's important to have a well established ranking for the participants by the end of the internship, so we can offer a good overview of their development
